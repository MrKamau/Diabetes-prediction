# Diabetes Prediction App  

## Data

 add  `data/` directory, 

## Pre-requisites

 python 3.6.7 
 
     packages
        - Pandas
        - Numpy
        - Scikit-learn
        - Pandas-profiling
        - ANN
        - Streamlit



```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Files
- diabetes_prediction_pipeline.ipynb 
             Jupyter Notebook with all the workings 
             include 
             pre-processing, modelling and inference.
- app.py : Streamlit App script
- requirements.txt : pre-requiste libraries for the project
- models/ : trained model files and scaler objects
- data/ : source data

 Here we use a real-world example of predicting if a patient has diabetes and built a machine learning model. 
 A Streamlit App  built using a step-by-step approach in this project.
